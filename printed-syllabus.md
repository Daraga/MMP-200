### Welcome to MMP 200.  You will find all of the most essential course content at the following links:

# MMP 200 FALL 2018 GITHUB REPO

This is where you will find all updated homework assignments, midterm proposal
prompts, and final project prompts.  This is also where markup languages, stylesheets,
code, and other content will be stored and accessible.

# CUNY VOCAT

You will not be able to log into VOCAT during week one, but this is where
students will find graded assignment expectations in rubric form and the
ability to submit their homework assignments in various media formats.
